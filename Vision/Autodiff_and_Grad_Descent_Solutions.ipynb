    "\n",
    "NumPy is the cornerstone for nearly all numerical and scientific computing software in Python, and thus it is desirable for us to spend our time focused on learning NumPy rather than splitting our attention across multiple array-math libraries.\n",
    "For this reason, MyGrad was specifically designed to to act and feel just like NumPy.\n",
    "Thus, if you want to get good at using MyGrad, you should spend most of your time [mastering NumPy!](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/module_3.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The crux of MyGrad is the `Tensor` object.\n",
    "This is analagous to NumPy's `ndarray`, as it: \n",
    "\n",
    "- can store [N-dimensional array data](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module3_IntroducingNumpy/AccessingDataAlongMultipleDimensions.html), which can be [manipulated (e.g. reshaped, transposed, etc.)](https://mygrad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tensor_manipulation.html)\n",
    "- supports both [basic indexing](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module3_IntroducingNumpy/BasicIndexing.html#Basic-Indexing) (accessing elements and subsections of tensor), [advanced indexing](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module3_IntroducingNumpy/AdvancedIndexing.html) (accessing arbitrary collections of elements from the tensor)\n",
    "- permits convenient [vectorized operations](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module3_IntroducingNumpy/VectorizedOperations.html), which obey [NumPy's broadcasting semantics](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module3_IntroducingNumpy/Broadcasting.html)\n",
    "- mirrors NumPy's mechanism for providing [views of data](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module3_IntroducingNumpy/BasicIndexing.html#Producing-a-View-of-an-Array) and [in-place updates on data](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module3_IntroducingNumpy/BasicIndexing.html#Augmenting-the-Underlying-Data-of-an-Array)\n",
    "\n",
    "What distinguishes the `Tensor` is that designed to support all of these features, _plus_ it enables automatic differentiation through any mathematical operations that involve tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are already at least familiar with each of the above concepts, then you are already well-along your way to being a competent MyGrad user!\n",
